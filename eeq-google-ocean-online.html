Hey - Pat from StarterStory.com (https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview. Today's interview is with Todd Trimakas of ByteStand (https://www.bytestand.com), a brand that sells shopify apps. Some stats: Product: Shopify apps. Revenue/mo: ,000 Started: January 2016 Location: Charlotte Founders: 1 Employees: 1 ### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start? Hi, my name is Todd and I’m a serial entrepreneur. After a long history /r/ChanceMe and other online forums can be helpful resources, but they leave a lot to be desired. Usually they don't include review of every part of your application and they lack critical context about you and the rest of the applicant pool. On top of that, most respondents don't have much by way of real information or qualifications. Competitiveness along with online anonymity sometimes drive people to be downright toxic. You will be spending 4+ of the most formative and impactful years. Any suggestions on where I could go and stay for a few months that would be relatively cheap? I used to travel a lot then settled down and worked for a few years. Now I am burnt out and just want a real break. Would love somewhere peaceful but not isolated where I can just relax, regroup, and figure out what is next in life. I will need to find some kind of work (hopefully online, maybe teaching?) as I don't have much money saved up. I will need decent internet. A bonus would be to be somewhere. 
Writing a column about local music isn’t as fun as it sounds. Sure, the free shows were an excellent perk, especially with my press badge allowing me backstage to talk to the artists performing. It isn’t as if I hated my job; I actually quite enjoyed it. And it paid quite well, too. The musicians themselves were usually very nice people. Sure, sometimes there were the ones who had no interest in you or answering your questions, and there was almost always the stale stench of cigarettes Myra Kindle is an independent investigative reporter. Her other reports: What does Google want with male sex workers?

Hello, I'm alive, yay! I haven't seen any more spooky stuff at my university, so I assume I'm fine. Maybe whatever it was left? Now, this unrelated, but I figured I'd share with you guys. I had a dream the other night, usually I'd discount it as well, just a dream, but it was oddly specific. It told me how to do a ritual, and I practiced it. It was supposed to summon a spirit animal or something, I haven't practiced it irl, so I have no idea if it works. Maybe it's one of those rituals which.

Most of the people here helped to pay for the game’s development—on average, 0 each, although some backers have given thousands. An epic sci-fi fantasy, Star Citizen was supposed to be finished in 2014. Warning. Great Wall Of Text ahead. So you've decided to head across the Pond to London for the two game series at the end of June. You're an absolute legend, following your team across an ocean, and we should have a suitcase statue in Monument Park for dedicated people like your good self. The only problem is, you don't know what you're going to do with yourself. Maybe you already have a game ticket, maybe you're hoping to snag one outside the stadium in the Stratford area of London, maybe. Hey - Pat from StarterStory.com (https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview. Today's interview is with Joshua Howarth of Wheely Sales (https://www.wheelysales.com), a brand that sells exit popup app. Some stats: Product: Exit popup app. Revenue/mo: 0 Started: October 2018 Location: Yokohama Founders: 1 Employees: 0 ### Hello!
