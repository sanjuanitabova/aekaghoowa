                            <p>Го́ты (англ. Goths, от англ. gothic — готический) — субкультура, зародившаяся в конце 1970-х годов в Великобритании на базе панк-движения. Церковь саентологии (ЦС) была создана в 1954 г. и на данный момент является наиболее известным течением саентологии. Бразильский альпинист Moeses Fiamoncini, испанцы Sergi Mingote и Carlos Garranzo и чилиец Juan Pablo Mohr нацелены на траверс Лхоцзе-Эверест без кислорода. Есть такая смешная история про студентов, спросивших своего бородатого профессора, как он спит со своей бородой – кладёт ли он её на одеяло или под одеяло.

I just listened to the whole thing today. (I realize I'm late to the party.) Some people were angry about the bleeped swear word in I Am, but I think it fits the point of view of the extravagant sinner that Sonny develops in the song. Altogether Murdered Love is in line with P.O.D.'s style.  I strongly believe that to understand how each type views the world, you look at the art they make and swear by. For this purpose I started r/MBTIRadioStation so that there's a place to discuss Music + Psychology + MBTI. I think musicians and artists explore a lot of their psyche and shadow through their art. Art is the greatest healer ! To understand the music r/INFJ likes and loves, I searched for "music" on the searchbar and pulled out some of the songs you peeps have posted here.

Just a thought. I appreciate that I had the opportunity to feel something close to that, even for just a few days, even if it wasn't real or mutual feeling. Society tries to shower us with illusions that there's someone for everybody or even the myth of "the one". All of this is built on the foundation of lies, deceit and handsome/wealthy/flawless personality people entitlement. Recent trends of civilization and advances of technology made high SMV individuals lives so much easier, there #Behemoth: Carl Orff's Carmina Burana (https://youtu.be/AdIpoE2LEps). While a tad clichéd, this piece does a great job of expressing the dreadful and terrifying power and presence of Behemoth. #Leviathan: Part II of Igor Stravinsky's Rite of Spring (https://youtu.be/FFPjFjUonX8?t=20m08s), after the introduction (20:08 to the end): Cercles Mystérieux des Adolescentes (Mystic Circle of the Young Girls) , Glorification de l'Élue (The Naming and Honoring of the Chosen I've submitted this before but really looking for more feedback on the story, pacing, characters, dialogue, etc. Thanks! LOGLINE - A troubled youth joins a local gang in order to uncover the truth behind a murdered love one. Here his ideas of justice will collide with a new, dangerous truth. https://drive.google.com/file/d/104ToctyRAcvjXXBahFw4V-XDgKRWY21m/view?usp=sharing. Hey there! This week we only played one song from our talented featured artist, OR3O, but that's because there's more to come! She's behind the "Doki Doki Literature Club" song "Doki Doki Forever" and I've plans for DDLC to be its own topic one of these Saturdays. Maybe I've said this before, but the music scene around DDLC really blew up. So. Yeah! That should be interesting! I hope you'll stop to hear it! Until then, enjoy this list of fan works. This week's playlist I love AMVs that have really good editing in them. What I mean by that is AMVs that have things like scenes/ideas synced to the music rather than just a hype song with random scenes stitched together. Here's an example of what I am NOT looking for: One Piece AMV - hope (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdxOs5jtZMw) And here's some examples of the kind of good stuff I am looking for: Into The Labyrinth (https://www.youtube.com /watch?v=lXX7dRULFaE) The Boy Who Murdered Love (https://www.y. 
This builds on some theories that people have been touching on throughout Reddit. I think there's a very strong possibility Arnold wanted the hosts to gain self awareness and the maze was a way of leading them to this. We don't know why Ford lets the maze exist, but we can assume if he knows about it and believes it could be a threat to his control, he'd destroy it. That leads us to a few possibilities: 1) He has taken control of the maze, therefore it is of no concern 2) He doesn't. spoilers I know it's a show and you have to leave some realism at the door but just for fun. with 0,000,000 I'd book a private jet in secret kill the guy watching for del right before you leave for the airport with the new identitys from the P.I. and move someplace beautiful where the dollars go even further like Bali or Something. Then hire full time security in a gated complex. Etc etc. the massive risk of him and his family being killed just screams run and hide / start I'm reposting my comment from other thread (because that thread was few days ago and I made the list today) because I think a lot of people are looking for some western songs to play in osu! when you're tired of anime songs and wubz. The list of course isn't full, there must have been some maps I just forgot and some I don't have, but I think it might be useful to some of you :-) Green Day - Sweet 16 by Zero__wind (https://osu.ppy.sh/b/297471) System of a Down - Aerials by Alarido (http. The thing that always impressed me with Gilmore Girls was the soundtrack. Many of the songs used, or musicians referenced, mirror my personal taste. Sometimes I was just straight up surprised to hear a song I really dug being played. Wondering if any of you had similar experiences watching? A few for me: Ween's It's Gonna Be a Long Night- played when Rory and Paris arrive at their hotel in Florida Sparks' Angst In My Pants- When Lorelai is altering Lane's wedding dress XTC's 
Can you imagine Flowey with the entirety of the underground under his use, but bored out of his mind. Just imagine him logging onto Alphys's or papyrus's old computer and sending Frisk emails just to make sure they don't forget about him. Dear Frisk.

EFFCAR? More like Eff-up, amarite? Heh heh heh. classic. Anyway, news? That's a good idea! Let's take a look at the headlines. Hmm. that's boring. That's boring. That's boring. Oooh, here's something good! VU's favourite hobo, Hobo Fred, has finally got a house! After about 20 years of flogging pills on a railway bridge, Hobo Fred has finally gone straight and gotten a job at the Boring Writing Institute, working on a 500-page report on the current state of taco-shell production in Chroma. Here is a better formatted version. ( I don’t listen to a lot of Christian-branded music these days. Most of contemporary Christian music is stuck in the ’90s, and there’s actually a market for that. There are a few bands that have stayed relevant to me, and have even had varying levels of mainstream success. Christian metal band P.O.D. just released their eight studio album, Murdered Love. I bought it tonight, and it’s great. 
• 106 - Viserys, after seeing how much the Dothraki love Daenerys, becomes jealous and tries to run away saying “Who can rule without wealth or fear of love.” (Daenerys well echo this sentiment in 804 and 805) • 204 – Daenerys “When my dragons are grown… we will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground.” • 206 – Daenerys “I will take what is mine with fire and blood.” • 207 - Cersei Lannister “Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they?

After my last post here about that guys girlfriend who was impregnated from rape. I received a ton of back lash, expected. Some of it even personal. Whatever, who gives a shit. I am not here to attack. Only to give perspective. I don’t think you guys are stupid or idiotic for believing a woman has no right to abort. In fact, I understand Every. Single. Scene. That included Arya, could've been replaced with Jon saving the people of King's Landing and it would've had 100000000000x more emotional impact because his decisions actually LED to this. Arya could've easily been scrubbed from this episode and it would've made 0 difference. What did she accomplish this entire episode? She infiltrated KL? Okay. She decided to leave half-way through the mission? Alright, that was a bit of a waste.
